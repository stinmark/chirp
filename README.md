**chirp** is a lightweight terminal reminder tool. Set a message and an interval, and chirp pops up a small floating window in your terminal to nudge you to stretch, take a break, drink water, or whatever else you need to remember right on schedule.

## Features

- **Simple dashboard** — a terminal UI for creating, viewing, and managing your reminders ("chirps")
- **Background daemon** — runs quietly in the background and checks every few seconds for due reminders
- **Auto-repeat** — set a chirp to fire once or keep repeating on its interval
- **Floating popups** — when a chirp is due, a small centered popup window pops up on top of everything else
- **Cross-platform** — native support for Windows and Linux (including Hyprland, GNOME, and KDE window placement)
- **Local storage only** — reminders are stored in a small JSON file in your OS config directory; nothing leaves your machine

## Installation

### Linux (curl install script)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stinmark/chirp/main/install.sh | sh
```

This detects your architecture, downloads the latest release binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/stinmark/chirp/releases), and installs it to `/usr/local/bin` (or `~/.local/bin` if that's not writable). To install a specific version instead of the latest:

```bash
CHIRP_VERSION=v0.1.0 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stinmark/chirp/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Windows (prebuilt binary)

Download the latest `chirp_windows_amd64.zip` (or `arm64` if you're on an ARM machine) from the [Releases page](https://github.com/stinmark/chirp/releases), extract it, and place `chirp.exe` somewhere on your `PATH`.

### Manual download (any platform)

Grab the archive for your OS/arch from the [Releases page](https://github.com/stinmark/chirp/releases), extract it, and move the `chirp` binary onto your `PATH`.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stinmark/chirp.git
cd chirp
go build -o chirp .
```

Move the resulting binary somewhere on your `PATH` (e.g. `/usr/local/bin` on Linux, or a folder already in your `PATH` on Windows).

## Usage

Run chirp with no flags to open the interactive dashboard:

```bash
chirp
```

From the dashboard you can create a new chirp (a message + an interval in minutes, with an optional auto-repeat toggle), view your existing chirps, and toggle them active or inactive.

Once you have at least one active chirp, start the background daemon so it can actually fire reminders:

```bash
chirp --run-daemon
```

The daemon forks itself into the background, watches your chirps, and spawns a floating popup window whenever one comes due. It automatically shuts itself down once there are no more active chirps, so you don't need to manage it by hand, just start it again whenever you add a new one.

To stop the daemon manually:

```bash
chirp --stop-daemon
```

### Flags

| Flag                         | Description                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--run-daemon`               | Starts the background scheduler that watches your chirps and triggers popups  |
| `--stop-daemon`              | Stops the currently running background daemon                                 |
| `--ui dashboard`             | Opens the interactive dashboard (also the default with no flags)              |
| `--ui popup --chirp-id <id>` | Opens the floating popup for a specific chirp (used internally by the daemon) |

## How it works

- Reminders ("chirps") are stored as JSON in your OS config directory (e.g. `~/.config/chirp/storage.json` on Linux, `%AppData%\chirp\storage.json` on Windows), with automatic migration from older storage formats.
- The daemon polls this storage every 5 seconds. When a chirp's scheduled time has passed, it spawns a small floating terminal window with your reminder message.
- On Windows, the popup is created as a new console window, centered and brought to the foreground.
- On Linux, chirp detects your desktop environment (Hyprland, GNOME, or KDE) and applies the appropriate rules to center, pin, and focus the popup window; it falls back gracefully on other setups.
